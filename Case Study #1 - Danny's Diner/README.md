## Question and Solution

The Database, along with the queries that will be executed for this project can be found here -> [DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/2rM8RAnq7h5LLDTzZiRWcd/138).


**1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**

````sql
SELECT
	sales.customer_id,
    SUM(menu.price) AS total_sales
FROM dannys_diner.sales
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY sales.customer_id
ORDER BY sales.customer_id ASC;
````
#### Steps:
- Used **JOIN** to merge `dannys_diner.sales` and `dannys_diner.menu` tables as `sales.customer_id` and `menu.price` are from both tables.
- Used **SUM** to calculate the total sales contributed by each customer.
- Grouped the aggregated results by `sales.customer_id`. 

#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_sales |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 76          |
| B           | 74          |
| C           | 36          |

From this Table, we can gather that:
- Customer A spent $76.
- Customer B spent $74.
- Customer C spent $36.

***

**2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**

````sql
SELECT 
	customer_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_date) AS visit_count
FROM dannys_diner.sales
GROUP BY customer_id;
````

#### Steps:
- To determine the unique number of visits for each customer, utilized **COUNT(DISTINCT `order_date`)**.
- Used the **DISTINCT** keyword to calculate the visit count to avoid duplicate counting of days. For example, if Customer A visited the restaurant twice on '2021‚Äì01‚Äì07', counting without **DISTINCT** would result in 2 days instead of the accurate count of 1 day.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | visit_count |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 4          |
| B           | 6          |
| C           | 2          |

From this Table, we can gather that:
- Customer A visited 4 times.
- Customer B visited 6 times.
- Customer C visited 2 times.

***

**3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?**

````sql
WITH ranked_sales AS (
	SELECT 
  		sales.customer_id,
  		sales.order_date,
  		menu.product_name,
  		ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
          PARTITION BY sales.customer_id
          ORDER BY sales.order_date ASC, sales.product_id ASC
        ) AS rn
  	FROM sales
  	JOIN menu
  		ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
  )
  SELECT 
  	customer_id,
    order_date,
    product_name AS first_item
    FROM ranked_sales
    WHERE rn = 1;
````
#### Steps:
- Used **ROW_NUMBER()** to assign a rank to each purchase per customer ordered by the earliest `order_date`
- On the off chance that items were bought on the same earliest date, the **ORDER BY sales.product_id** would ensure consistent picking.
- We lastly filter this query with 'WHERE rn = 1' to keep the first item per customer.
  
| customer_id | product_name | 
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | sushi        | 
| B           | curry        | 
| C           | ramen        |

From this Table, we can gather that:
- Customer A placed an order for both curry and sushi simultaneously, making them the first items in the order.
- Customer B's first order is curry.
- Customer C's first order is ramen.

**4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?**

````sql
SELECT
	menu.product_name,
    COUNT(sales.product_id) AS total_purchases
FROM dannys_diner.sales
JOIN dannys_diner.menu
ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY menu.product_name
ORDER BY total_purchases DESC
LIMIT 1;
````

#### Steps:
- Used a **COUNT** aggregation on the `product_id` column and **ORDER BY** the result in descending order using `total_purchases` field.
- Used the **LIMIT** 1 clause to filter and retrieve the top-selling item.

#### Answer:
| most_purchased | product_name | 
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 8       | ramen |


From this Table, we can gather that:
- Ramen is the most purchased item on the menu !

***

**5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?**

````sql
WITH customer_item_counts AS (
  SELECT 
  	s.customer_id,
  	m.product_name,
  	COUNT(*) AS purchase_count
  FROM sales s
  JOIN menu m
  	ON s.product_id = m.product_id
  GROUP BY s.customer_id, m.product_name
),
ranked_items AS ( 
  SELECT 
  	customer_id,
  	product_name,
  	purchase_count,
  	RANK() OVER (
      PARTITION BY customer_id
      ORDER BY purchase_count DESC
    ) AS rnk
   FROM customer_item_counts
  )
 SELECT 
 	customer_id,
    product_name AS most_popular_itme,
    purchase_count
 FROM ranked_items
 WHERE rnk = 1
 ORDER BY customer_id;
````

*Each user may have more than 1 favourite item.*

#### Steps:
- Used a **COUNT** aggregation to see how many times each customer ordered each product `customer_item_counts`.
- Using `purchase_count` we ranked items per customer
- Then used the **RANK** function in the case of a tie, we return all top items.
- Finally, used a filter with `WHERE rnk = 1`.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | product_name | order_count |
| ----------- | ---------- |------------  |
| A           | ramen        |  3   |
| B           | sushi        |  2   |
| B           | curry        |  2   |
| B           | ramen        |  2   |
| C           | ramen        |  3   |

From this Table, we can gather that:
- Customer A and C's favourite item is ramen.
- Customer B enjoys all items on the menu.

***

**6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?**

```sql
WITH member_sales AS (
  SELECT
  	s.customer_id,
  	s.order_date,
  	m.product_name,
  	ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
      PARTITION BY s.customer_id
      ORDER BY s.order_date ASC, s.product_id ASC
      ) AS rn
  	FROM sales s
  	JOIN menu m
  	ON s.product_id = m.product_id
  	JOIN members mem
  	ON s.customer_id = mem.customer_id
  	WHERE s.order_date >= mem.join_date
  )
SELECT customer_id, order_date, product_name AS first_item_after_join
FROM member_sales
WHERE rn = 1
ORDER BY customer_id;
```

#### Steps:
- Created a CTE named `member_sales` then selected the appropriate columns and calculated the row number using the **ROW_NUMBER()** function. The **PARTITION BY** clause divides the data by `s.customer_id` and the **ORDER BY** clause orders the rows within each `s.order_date` and `s.product_id` ASC.
- Then joined the tables `members` and `sales` on `customer_id` column. Additionally, applied a condition to include sales that occurred *On or After* the member's `join_date` (`s.order_date >= mem.join_date`).
- Then used the **WHERE** clause in the **Outer Query** to filter and retrieve only the rows where the rn column = 1, representing the first row within each `customer_id` partition.
- Lastly, ordered result by `customer_id`.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | product_name |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| A           | curry        |
| B           | sushi        |

From this Table, we can gather that:
- Customer A's first order as a member is curry.
- Customer B's first order as a member is sushi.

***

**7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?**

````sql
WITH pre_member_sales AS ( 
  SELECT
  	s.customer_id,
  	s.order_date,
  	m.product_name,
  	ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
      PARTITION BY s.customer_id
      ORDER BY s.order_date DESC, s.product_id DESC
      ) AS rn
  FROM sales s
  JOIN menu m 
  	ON s.product_id = m.product_id
  JOIN members mem
  	ON s.customer_id = mem.customer_id
  WHERE s.order_date < mem.join_date
  )
  SELECT
  	customer_id,
    order_date,
    product_name AS last_item_before_join
  FROM pre_member_sales
  WHERE rn = 1
  ORDER BY customer_id;
````

#### Steps:
- Created a CTE called `pre_member_sales`. 
- Select the appropriate columns and calculate the rank using the **ROW_NUMBER()** window function. The rank is determined based on the order dates of the sales along with the product ID in descending order.
- Join `dannys_diner.sales` table with `dannys_diner.menu` table and the `dannys_diner.members` table so we can filter by membership join date.
- Then used the **WHERE** clause to keep sales that only happened before the customer became a member.
- Then filtered the result set to include only the rows where the rank = 1, representing the earliest purchase made by each customer before they became a member.
- Finally, sorted the result by `customer_id`.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | product_name |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| A           | curry        |
| B           | sushi        |

From this Table, we can gather that:
- Customers A last item purchased pre-membership was curry
- Customers B last item purchased pre-membership was sushi

***

**8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?**

```sql
SELECT 
	mem.customer_id,
    COUNT(s.product_id) AS total_items,
    SUM(m.price) AS total_amount
FROM sales s
JOIN menu m
	ON s.product_id = m.product_id
JOIN members mem
	ON s.customer_id = mem.customer_id
WHERE s.order_date < mem.join_date
GROUP BY mem.customer_id
ORDER BY mem.customer_id;
```

#### Steps:
- Selected the columns `mem.customer_id` and then used the **COUNT** aggregation to count `sales.product_id` as total_items for each customer. Then used the  **SUM** aggregation to sum the `m.price` as total_sales.
- Joined the `sales`,`menu`, and `members` table, then used the **WHERE** clause to filter the `s.order_date` and `mem.join_date` to keep only the rows where the purchase date is before the customer's join date.
- Grouped the results by `mem.customer_id`.
- Ordered the result by `mem.customer_id`.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_items | total_sales |
| ----------- | ---------- |----------  |
| A           | 2 |  25       |
| B           | 3 |  40       |

From this Table, we can gather that:
Before becoming members,
- Customer A spent $25 on 2 items.
- Customer B spent $40 on 3 items.

***

**9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier ‚Äî how many points would each customer have?**

```sql
SELECT s.customer_id,
	SUM(
      CASE
      	WHEN m.product_name = 'sushi' THEN m.price * 10 * 2
      	ELSE m.price * 10
      END
     ) AS total_points
FROM sales s
JOIN menu m 
	ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id
ORDER BY s.customer_id;
```

#### Steps:
- Used a `CASE` expression to calculate points, if product name = sushi, then apply the 2x points multiplier, otherwise, multiply price by 10.
- Then joined the `sales` and `menu` table
- Finally Grouped and Ordered rows by `s.customer_id`

#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_points | 
| ----------- | ---------- |
| A           | 860 |
| B           | 940 |
| C           | 360 |

From this Table, we can gather that:
- Total points for Customer A is $860.
- Total points for Customer B is $940.
- Total points for Customer C is $360.
