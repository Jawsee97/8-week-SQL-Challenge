## Business Task
Danny wants to analyze customer data to understand visiting patterns, spending habits, and favorite items. These insights will guide loyalty program decisions and provide simple datasets his team can review without using SQL.

## Question and Solution

The Database, along with the queries I will be executing for this project can be found here -> [DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/2rM8RAnq7h5LLDTzZiRWcd/138).


**1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**

````sql
SELECT
	sales.customer_id,
    SUM(menu.price) AS total_sales
FROM dannys_diner.sales
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY sales.customer_id
ORDER BY sales.customer_id ASC;
````
#### Steps:
- Used **JOIN** to merge `dannys_diner.sales` and `dannys_diner.menu` tables as `sales.customer_id` and `menu.price` are from both tables.
- Used **SUM** to calculate the total sales contributed by each customer.
- Grouped the aggregated results by `sales.customer_id`. 

#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_sales |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 76          |
| B           | 74          |
| C           | 36          |

From this Table, we can gather that:
- Customer A spent $76.
- Customer B spent $74.
- Customer C spent $36.
